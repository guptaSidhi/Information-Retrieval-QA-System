PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY\nZscaler has adopted this Anti-Bribery Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) to ensure that Zscaler (and its partners,\naffiliates, and agents) meets its legal and compliance obligations under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the OECD Convention on Anti-Bribery, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of\n2010 (\u201cBribery Act\u201d), or any other applicable anti-bribery laws or international anti-bribery standards\n(collectively the \u201cAnti-Bribery Laws\u201d).  Zscaler mandates compliance with the Anti-Bribery Laws in\nall of the countries in which Zscaler operates or conducts business.  This Policy is applicable to all\nZscaler employees, directors, officers, board members, and any other individual or entity acting for or\non behalf of Zscaler, anywhere in the world (collectively \u201cZscaler Individuals\u201d).\nViolation of the Anti-Bribery Laws may have serious consequences including large civil and criminal\nfines for Zscaler and fines and prison terms for the responsible Zscaler Individuals.\nViolation of this Policy may be grounds for discipline, immediate termination, prosecution, or\nadditional sanctions.\nII. POLICY STATEMENT\nZscaler Individuals will not make, offer to make, or promise to make a \u201cbribe\u201d to any person.\nZscaler Individuals will not provide, offer to provide, or promise to provide \u201canything of value\u201d\nto any \u201cforeign official\u201d unless such action has been approved in advance and in writing by the\nZscaler Legal Department.\nAll entertainment, meals, gifts or travel must be reasonable, not extravagant, and will only be\nprovided to customer personnel and other persons in accordance with the Entertainment,\nMeals, Gifts & Travel Section of this Policy.\nIII. DEFINITIONS\nA \u201cbribe\u201d is any offer or payment of \u201canything of value\u201d made to an individual to induce that\nindividual to (a) act in bad faith or (b) violate a position of trust or duty of impartiality for the purpose\nof securing a business advantage for Zscaler.\n\u201cAnything of value\u201d includes cash, gifts, travel expenses, entertainment, offers of employment,\nprovision of free services, and business meals, regardless of the value.

ENTERTAINMENT, MEALS, GIFTS & TRAVEL POLICY \nGeneral Policy \nAnti-Bribery Laws may prohibit certain kinds or amounts of entertainment, meals, gifts and travel \nprovided to customer personnel and other persons under certain circumstances.  Therefore, no \nentertainment, meals, gift or travel should ever be offered, given or provided unless: \n\u2217 It is reasonable, not extravagant and appropriate under the circumstances and under U.S. and \nlocal customs; \n\u2217 It serves a valid business purpose and is directly related to the promotion, demonstration or \nexplanation of products or services or the performance of a contract; \n\u2217 It is not offered for any improper purpose and cannot be construed as a bribe; \n\u2217 It does not violate this Policy or any other Zscaler policy; \n\u2217 It does not violate any U.S., local or international laws or regulations; and \n\u2217 It is accurately described in the expense reports and Zscaler\u2019s books and records. \nThe rules set forth in this Section apply whether you are giving the entertainment, meals, gifts and \ntravel or other benefits yourself or through a third party. \nIf you have any question regarding the appropriateness of any gift or expense, you should consult \nZscaler\u2019s Legal Department prior to incurring the expense. \nPolicy for Foreign Officials \nThe FCPA is a U.S. law that focuses on bribes provided to foreign officials.  Specifically, under the \nFCPA, individuals must not make, offer to make, or promise to make a bribe, directly or indirectly, to \nany foreign official to assist Zscaler in obtaining or retaining an improper business advantage, \nwhether or not any benefit is actually received. \nThe FCPA is very broad, so that many kinds of entertainment, meals, gifts and travel provided to \nforeign officials might be considered improper, regardless of their value.  As a result, the FCPA may \nprohibit actions that would not violate laws that govern transactions between commercial, non-\ngovernment parties. \nTherefore, Zscaler strictly regulates providing anything of value to any foreign official.  Zscaler \nIndividuals will not provide, offer to provide, or promise to provide \u201canything of value\u201d to any \nforeign official unless such action has been approved in advance and in writing by the Zscaler Legal \nDepartment.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2743, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1620696d-c11d-47b5-9443-d01bf89ff2e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1620696d-c11d-47b5-9443-d01bf89ff2e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Zscaler Anti Bribery Policy.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\SIDHIG~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp4iu2cy_l\\Zscaler Anti Bribery Policy.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 152003, "creation_date": "2025-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-20"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c537e3c-5163-4bde-acc7-73c4dc02d1c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Zscaler Anti Bribery Policy.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\SIDHIG~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp4iu2cy_l\\Zscaler Anti Bribery Policy.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 152003, "creation_date": "2025-04-20", "last_modified_date": "2025-04-20"}, "hash": "cf97459b6e3afaa29cddc76a7140e21f9a5f3590057aa110d88f3976d8b1d11c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "-3- \nInternal Policies of Customer \nCustomers\u2019 internal anti-bribery policies may prohibit certain kinds or amounts of entertainment, \nmeals, gifts and travel provided to their personnel.

These representatives are retained in part for their knowledge of and access to persons in \nthe local market and for their ability to secure and retain business.  The prohibitions of this Policy \napply to Zscaler representatives who may act on Zscaler\u2019s behalf.
